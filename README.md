For the Arc theme, the syntax coloring is the default VS Code one. For Adapta, it is taken from [Mattia Astorino's great Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/vsc-material-theme) (an alternative to this Adapta theme!)

I created those themes myself to suit my needs - I hope you wil like it too!
